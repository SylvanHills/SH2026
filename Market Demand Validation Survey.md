## Survey Design Notes (Internal — Do Not Include in Survey)

### Flow & Logic
- **Q22 → Q23:** Only show Q23 if respondent selects "Yes" in Q22
- **Estimated completion time:** 6–8 minutes
- Keep the tone conversational and on-brand — avoid corporate survey language

### Key Metrics to Track
| Metric | Source | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Purchase intent at target price | Q20 ("Very likely" + "Likely") | 30%+ |
| Brand concept resonance | Q15 ("Very interested" + "Somewhat interested") | 50%+ |
| Product concept appeal | Q19 ("Very appealing" + "Somewhat appealing") | 50%+ |
| Gap in market validation | Q17 ("Yes" + "Somewhat") | 40%+ |
| Waitlist conversion | Q22 ("Yes") | 20%+ |

### Distribution Strategy
- Share in relevant online communities (Reddit: r/malefashionadvice, r/malefashion, r/streetwear)
- Personal network — friends, colleagues, and extended circles
- Instagram stories / polls to drive traffic
- LinkedIn if professional network skews toward target demo
- Consider a small incentive (e.g., early access, discount code) to boost completion rates

### Analysis Approach
- Segment responses by age range and spending habits to identify your strongest customer cohort
- Cross-reference Q8 pain points with Q15/Q17 to validate that the brand positioning addresses real frustrations
- Use open-response answers (Q9, Q10, Q16, Q24, Q25) for qualitative themes to refine messaging
- Compare Q18 (brand comparisons) against your intended competitive positioning
